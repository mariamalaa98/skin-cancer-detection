# 🧬 Skin Cancer Detection – Deep Learning Project

Welcome to the **Skin Cancer Detection** project — a computer vision solution that leverages deep learning to classify skin lesions and assist in early diagnosis of skin cancer. This model aims to support medical professionals and individuals by providing a fast, automated, and reliable prediction system trained on real dermatological image data.
